Frontend developer notes

Install:
1. cd frontend
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

Notes:
- This is a Vite React starter. Replace styles with your design system.
- Keycloak: create a realm 'ecitizen' and a client 'ecitizen-frontend' (public client).
- On login, call Keycloak OIDC endpoints and store ID token in memory.

UX: The code includes a FormBuilder component and sample pages aligned to UXP.
